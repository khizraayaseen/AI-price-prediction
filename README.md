# Clothes Price Prediction

Clothes Price Prediction is an AI project developed using Google Colab, Python, and machine learning techniques. This project aims to predict clothing prices by analyzing various features using regression models. After evaluating different regression models such as Decision Tree, Neural Network, Support Vector Classifier, and Lasso Regression, Linear Regression was chosen as the final model due to its superior accuracy.

## Brief Description

The Clothes Price Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of clothing items based on multiple features. By training a Linear Regression model on a dataset containing relevant features such as brand, material, size, and color, the project achieves accurate predictions of clothing prices.

## Features

### 1. Regression Model Selection

- Evaluation of multiple regression models including Decision Tree, Neural Network, Support Vector Classifier, and Lasso Regression.
- Selection of Linear Regression model based on superior accuracy for clothing price prediction.

### 2. Dataset Analysis

- Analysis of a dataset containing clothing data with features like brand, material, size, color, etc.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Preprocessing and transformation of features to prepare data for model training.

### 4. Model Training

- Training the Linear Regression model on the prepared dataset to predict clothing prices.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Evaluation of the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, etc.

### 6. Prediction

- Utilization of the trained model to make predictions on new clothing data.
